									<h2>Welcome to bfgn</h2>
								</header>
								<p>Hello there!  You've found bfgn, a package for using convolutional neural
									networks (CNNs) in remote sensing research.  If you're using remotely sensed
									imagery (or even large lab images) and want to use a context-based model
									(where multiple pixels used to make decisions), and you're looking for a way to
									test, compare, and deploy architectures, you're in the right place.
								</p>

								<p>bfgn is an extension of <a href="https://github.com/pgbrodrick/ecoCNN"> ecoCNN</a>,
									which was published with the paper <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tree.2019.03.006">
									"Uncovering ecological patterns with convolutional neural networks"</a>.
								</p>

								<h2 align="left">What it is</h2>
								<div align="left">
									bfgn was designed as an internal research tool, one that we've now opened up in
									the event that others want to use it.  It's a package that manages several
									common components of the cnn development pipeline in the geospatial research
									context, including converting raw raster/shape files into training data,
									training models (with a series of customizable templates of common network types),
									the application of those models over large areas, and the generation of error reports
									to assess and compare models.
								</div>
								<br>
								<h2 align="left">What it isn't</h2>
                                <div align="left">
									This is not a perfected package to solve all of your geospatial CNN needs.
									It is a by-product of our existing research commitments and is not guaranteed to
									be bug-free, nor have extensive test coverage or exhaustive best practices.
									We're working to continue and improve things, and welcome any help.  See something
									you think should be improved?  Contribute!

								<div align="left">All code is available on the main
									<a href="https://github.com/pgbrodrick/bfg-nets">repository</a>, along with several
									examples (more examples and tutorials to come soon).
									The examples are a good way to get a handle on the workflow of bfgn.

								<br>

								<div align="left"> To get going with the package, clone and install the repository -
									we recommend using the provided conda environment
									files (available for both gpu and cpu environments).  Installation details are on
									the repository home page.</div>
